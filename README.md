# üß† Waiter-Calling ‚Äì AI-Based Desk and Hand Raise Detection

A computer vision project that detects when a person raises their hand in an office to request coffee. It uses OpenCV and color segmentation to identify desks from images or video feeds and leverages deep learning models to detect hand gestures, enabling an automated waiter-calling or seating system.

## üí° Features

1. **Desk Detection via Color Segmentation**  
   Detects green-colored desks from static images or video frames using HSV filtering.

2. **Hand Raise Detection**  
   Uses MediaPipe and YOLOv8 models to detect when a user raises a hand at their desk.

3. **Real-time Video Processing**  
   Processes videos in real time to track user activity.

4. **Visual Feedback**  
   Annotates detected hands and desks on video output for easy visualization.

5. **Interactive Notebook**  
   Easy-to-follow code in a Jupyter notebook (`Sonjoy_Waiter_c_sol.ipynb`), ideal for experimentation and demo purposes.
